   This is my first time to setup blog. I noticed the new word *'jekyll'* in someone's blog in early.I googled it,and enjoy it.

 >  
 - The blog use Jekyll-Bootstrap hosted on GitHub pages. It don't like WordPress,you don't own any server.
 - Use the git control the blog version.You don't have to worry about the Internet. 
 - markdown,is a lightweight markup language，it has the simple grammar.I can even code it easily by vim which I absolutely don't good at.

Then I try to setup one .
In the process of building the site, I also learned a lot of new things.

The git command,I used to copy someone's code on github,but never detail.

markdown,The first time I realized this simple but powerful markup language.You can try it on[简网](http://jianshu.io/).

If you want to experience this kind of lightweight and convenient process of blog.You should start google the 'jekyll'.
