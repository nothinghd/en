This is my first time to setup blog. I noticed the new word *'jekyll'* in someone's blog in early.I googled it ,and enjoy it.

 >  
 - The blog use Jekyll-Bootstrap hosted on GitHub pages. It don't like WordPress,you don't own any server.
 - Use the git control the blog version.You don't have to worry about the Internet. 
 - markdown,is a lightweight markup language，it has the simple grammar.I can even code it easily by vim which I absolutely don't good at.

Then I try to setup one 。嘿嘿，模板是某一天悄悄在别人那fork来
的，不要觉得眼熟。。
In the process of building the site, I also learned a lot of new things.
git命令，以前经常在github上偷代码，了不起用个clone，从来也没仔细学习过
git。
markdown，The first time I realized this simple but powerful markup language。You can try it on[简网](http://jianshu.io/).

If you want to experience this kind of lightweight and convenient process of blog.You should start google the 'jekyll'.
